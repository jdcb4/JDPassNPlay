# Deployment — JDPassNPlay

This is a static browser app. No server-side state, no database, no API.

## Local production preview

```bash
pnpm run build
pnpm run preview
```

`pnpm run build` typechecks and writes the static app to `dist`.

## Docker

Build the image with the project script (it tags both versioned and `latest`):

```bash
pnpm run docker:build
```

Tags produced:

```text
jdcb4/jdpassnplay:<package version>
jdcb4/jdpassnplay:latest
```

Run locally:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8080:80 jdcb4/jdpassnplay:latest
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:8080/.

The image serves the Vite `dist` output through Nginx with SPA fallback to `index.html`.

## GitHub Pages

The workflow is `.github/workflows/pages.yml`.

Repository setup (one-time):

1. Push the project to GitHub.
2. Open `Settings → Pages`.
3. Set `Build and deployment` source to `GitHub Actions`.
4. Push to `main` (or run the workflow manually).

The Pages base path is set in `vite.config.ts` and currently uses `/jdpassnplay/`. If the GitHub repository name differs from the project slug, update the `base` value in `vite.config.ts` and run `pnpm run build:pages` to verify.

## Verification before deploy

```bash
pnpm run verify
```

For Pages-specific changes also run:

```bash
pnpm run build:pages
```

For Docker-specific changes also run:

```bash
pnpm run docker:build
```
